For this project the first thing I did was copy over all the files provided and also the area51 tests for flist.

Next I created all the deliverable files aand started work on name.com

My first major issues looked like this:

amS abLm

The name did not sort at all and was all but useless

For quite a few tries I got Sam_Labm and could not figure out how to resolve the issue.
what ended up working was decrementing the stack before the m like this:

12a
1a
1++
1++
12m
11S
12_
2ia
2a
22b
21L
2-- //This decrement fixed the mistake of the b coming before the m
2++
2++
2im
3=1
3+=2
3d
q

After that was resolved the output looks like this:

Sam_Lamb 

Which is as intended

I copied over list2c.api into list2c.h as advised in the project files and chanced a few of the function types to bool (they were void)
When this was hammered out the next step was to start on list2c.cpp and figure out how to configure those functions within.

The functions I had to implement were Init, Excess, and Capacity
Capacity simply takes excess and size and adds them to show the full capacity of a link structure.
The excess are the components on the "Dark side" of link structures that are not always seen.

Some of the errors I initially faced:

There were a few errors when the webmail was checked that I did not expect.
<      x1.Dump(*osptr): HGDSAMNBVCXFZ**KJ

     x1.Dump(*osptr): HGDSAMNBVCXZ**KJ

<   5 = x1.Excess();
<   15 = x1.Capacity();
---
  4 = x1.Excess();
  14 = x1.Capacity();

  My file is printing an actra "F" that is not showing up
  This puts the excess and capacity


<      x1.Dump(*osptr): XBzCDEZ*AY*

     x1.Dump(*osptr): XBzCDEZ**

The file here is printing an "AY" that I could not find an explainiation for



otherwise the robocheck seemed to have gone well.
